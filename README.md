# qml-RQDA
This repository contains a QtCreator project containing a QML frontent for rqda-files. 

I do not think that `RGtk2` is really required as a GUI for RQDA. Instead I assume that it would be more feasible to have

1) a modern platform independent GUI for graphical interaction with the project
2) a trimmed down R libraray for all other interactions with the project

Currently this is a read only GUI capable of opening projects and displaying what the main RQDA QUI was showing.

A word of warning: to me this is a hobby project learning about Qt and QML and I have no intention to use RQDA or even this project for anything else but learning about GUI Coding.
